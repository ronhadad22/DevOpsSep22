Kernel System Calls
-------------------

So the program is very simple, first we download a file which called whatIdo using wget command,
then we simply change the mode of the file to executable so it becomes usable.
then we execute the file whatIdo

# stat("./welcomeToDevOpsMay22", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0700, st_size=4096, ...}) = 0

first it does a stat command on ./welcomeToDevOpsMay22

# openat(AT_FDCWD, "welcomeToDevOpsMay22/goodLuck", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 3

then it goes to welcomeToDevOpsMay22/goodLuck

# write(3, "There you go... tell me what I d"..., 36) = 36

and write to the file "There you go... tell me what I do..."

############################################

mkdir welcomeToDevOpsMay22
cd welcomeToDevOpsMay22
nano goodLuck
echo “There you go… tell me what I do…”

Binary Numbers
--------------

1.  7,4,22
2.  0 through 255
3.  In order to represent a negative 8 bit binary number, we can use the 9th bit to declare whether the number is positive or negative (0 = positive, 1 = negative)
4.  To convert fraction to binary, start with the fraction in question and multiply it by 2,  Continue multiplying by 2 until you get a resulting fractional part equal to zero. Then just write out the integer parts from the results of each multiplication.
